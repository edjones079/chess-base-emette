Using your chess code that you added the FEN string setup to add chess movement for the following pieces:

    pawns

Remember that Pawns capture differently than they move.

 Take a screenshot of the chessboard with all the pieces in place and a second screenshot showing a breakpoint after your move generator has generated its first moves with 20 moves in the array. 

 Add these screenshots to your github directory so they show up on your github page. Submit the address of your github repository for review.
