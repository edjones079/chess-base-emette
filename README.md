Now you have a working chess program with moves generated for kings, knights and pawns, and white and black playing properly turn by turn.

Add the rest of the movement using: 

    Magic bitboards

    A negamax AI that works to a depth of at least THREE and uses alpha/beta pruning to speed up it's search so that you can play against the computer. The AI only needs to play as BLACK, but you should write the code so that it can play as either color should you wish to add AI vs. AI in the future.

Negamax with alpha/beta pruning is described here and was implemented live in class this week. I wrote a breakdown of that class here. You can follow or the negamax code from your tic-tac-toe game as the basis for this code.

    You will need to write an evaluation function for your board as we discussed in class.

    Edit your code's README.md describing your challenges, depth achieved, and how well your AI plays., commit it to the repo and submit the GitHub repo URL for the assignment. 
    
    To help grading, please also provide a video of your chess AI playing the game against yourself for a few moves.
